   - Log viewing

#### Enable API Access
1. Navigate to **Advanced** ‚Üí **System** ‚Üí **Management**
2. Enable **Remote Management** if needed
3. Configure **Access Control** to allow HomeOS server IP

### 2. HomeOS Configuration

#### Environment Variables
Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
# TP-Link ER605 Router Configuration
ROUTER_ENABLED=true
ROUTER_HOST=192.168.1.1

ROUTER_PASSWORD=your-router-admin-password
ROUTER_TIMEOUT=10000
ROUTER_POLL_INTERVAL=30000
NETWORK_SCAN_INTERVAL=60000
NETWORK_DEVICE_TIMEOUT=5000
NETWORK_BANDWIDTH_HISTORY_DAYS=7
SECURITY_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=30
SECURITY_ALERT_THRESHOLD=5
```

#### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `ROUTER_HOST` | Router IP address | `192.168.1.1` |
| `ROUTER_USERNAME` | Admin username | `admin` |
| `ROUTER_PASSWORD` | Admin password | Required |
| `ROUTER_TIMEOUT` | API timeout (ms) | `10000` |
| `ROUTER_POLL_INTERVAL` | Data refresh interval (ms) | `30000` |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Failed
- **Check router IP**: Ensure `ROUTER_HOST` matches your router's IP
- **Verify credentials**: Confirm username and password are correct
- **Network connectivity**: Ensure HomeOS server can reach the router
- **Firewall settings**: Check if router firewall blocks the connection

#### No Devices Detected
- **Router permissions**: Ensure the user has device monitoring permissions
- **API access**: Verify API access is enabled in router settings
- **Network scan**: Check if network scanning is enabled

#### Security Events Not Showing
- **Security features**: Ensure router security features are enabled
- **Log level**: Check router log level settings
- **Event retention**: Verify security log retention settings

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by setting:
```bash
DEBUG_NETWORK=true
```

This will provide detailed logging for network operations.

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices
1. **Dedicated User**: Create a dedicated router user for HomeOS
2. **Strong Password**: Use a strong, unique password for the router account
3. **Network Isolation**: Consider network segmentation for IoT devices
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep router firmware updated
5. **Access Control**: Limit management access to trusted devices

### Data Privacy
- Network data is stored locally in HomeOS
- No external services are used for network monitoring
- Device information remains within your local network
- Security events are logged locally only

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Device Types
You can customize device type detection by modifying the device classification logic in the NetworkService.

### Bandwidth Alerts
Set up custom bandwidth usage alerts by configuring thresholds in the environment variables.

### Integration with Other Services
The network monitoring data can be integrated with other HomeOS features:
- Energy monitoring correlation
- Security system integration
- Automated device management
